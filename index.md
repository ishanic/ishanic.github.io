## About

I am a Computer Vision Researcher in Microsoft Mixed Reality, pursuing problems in Semantic Understanding for Hololens. My interests lies in applying geometry to constrain visual perception through physical, geometric and multi-view consistency. Before joining Hololens, I was at Microsoft AI & R where I developed the Multi-People Tracking system for Reality-as-a-Service. I have led multiple incubation projects that have converged into various Azure Computer Vision products. My previous stint was as a researcher at SRI International in Princeton, NJ, where I worked on various IARPA funded projects. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science, specializing in Computer Vision and Probabilistic Graphical Models. Throughout my career, I have participated in delivering successful prototypes, won research grants and primary author of over 15 publications and patents.
